/**
 * Interface to persistent symbols.
 *
 * <p>
 * A Symbol is an inexpensive object that behaves like a singleton --
 * except that you can create as many as you want.  Each Symbol is
 * created with a String, and a unique Symbol is assigned to this
 * String.  Any fetches of that String will return the same Symbol.
 * <p>
 * Symbols cannot be constructed, but must be fetched through the "of"
 * operator.
 * <p>
 * Symbols are hashable, because they are singletons, so the default hashCode
 * based on Object address should work.
