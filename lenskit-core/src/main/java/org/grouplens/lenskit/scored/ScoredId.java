/**
 * A numerical ID associated with a score and optional side channels.
 * A {@code ScoredId} object is intended to be immutable.  Scored IDs can be created by using the
 * {@linkplain ScoredIds#newBuilder() builder} or accumulated in a {@link PackedScoredIdList}.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the score, a scored id associates <em>channels</em> with the id.  Channels are
 * identified by {@link TypedSymbol}s.  As an optimization, channels of type {@code double} can be
 * accessed in unboxed fashion using an untyped {@link Symbol}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A channel, if it is present, cannot contain {@code null}.
